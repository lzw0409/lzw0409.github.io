About Me

Hi all, I'm a recent computer science graduate. I was born in Chongqing China. I am study in User Interaction design currently, also, I will study in Design informatic at University of Edinburgh next year for graduate school.I believe this virtual intern opportunity would be a great chance for me to become more proficient in latest programming practices and to thrive in a team environment. In the mean time,  I want to have more programmin experience other than the school project. It's my pleasure to be in the team. Looking forward to work with everyone.
